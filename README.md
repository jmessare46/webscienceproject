# SHOP RPI

## Description
Our project is based on the idea of making RPI’s food infrastructure more readily available and accessible to it’s students. SHOP RPI has two different ends to it, the first side is a general user interface. This interface would allow users to search for food on RPI campus, match prices, view store information, and set their favorite stores. There is a vendor interface that allows store and shop owners to update their prices and inventory to properly advertise what they currently have available. This application also has preferences set by users to prioritize their experience with the application.
